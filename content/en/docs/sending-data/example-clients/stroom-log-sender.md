  A Docker image for peridoically sending log files generated by an application to Stroom.
---

{{< external-link "stroom-log-sender" "https://hub.docker.com/r/gchq/stroom-log-sender/" >}} is a small Docker image for sending data to _Stroom_. 

This is the simplest way to get data into stroom if the data provider is itself running in docker. 
It can also be used for sending data to _Stroom_ from data providers that are not running in Docker.
_stroom-log-sender_ makes use of the _send_to_stroom.sh_ bash script that is described below.
For details on how to use _stroom-log-sender_, see the Dockerhub link above.
