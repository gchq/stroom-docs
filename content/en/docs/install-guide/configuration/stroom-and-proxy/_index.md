  How to configure Stroom and Stroom-Proxy.
---

The Stroom and Stroom-Proxy applications are built on the same Dropwizard framework so have a lot of similarities when it comes to configuration.

The Stroom/Stroom-Proxy applications are essentially just an executable {{< external-link "JAR" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_%28file_format%29" >}} file that can be run when provided with a configuration file, `config.yml`.
This config file is common to all forms of deployment.
