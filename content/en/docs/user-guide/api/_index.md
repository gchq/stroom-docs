  Stroom' public REST APIs for querying and interacting with all aspects of Stroom.

---

_Stroom_ has many public REST {{< glossary "API" "APIs">}} to allow other systems to interact with _Stroom_.
Everything that can be done via the user interface can also be done using the API.

All methods on the API will are authenticated and authorised, so the permissions will be exactly the same as if the API user is using the Stroom user interface directly.
