Stroom has been in use by GCHQ for many years and is used to process logs from a large number of different systems.
This sections aims to provide some guidelines on how to name and organise your content, e.g. Feeds, XSLTs, Pipelines, Folders, etc.
These are not hard rules and you do not have to follow them, however it may help when it comes to sharing content.
