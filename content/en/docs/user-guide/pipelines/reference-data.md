In Stroom reference data is primarily used to decorate events using `stroom:lookup()` calls in XSLTs.
For example you may have reference data feed that associates the FQDN of a device to the physical location.
You can then perform a `stroom:lookup()` in the XSLT to decorate an event with the physical location of a device by looking up the FQDN found in the event.

Reference data is time sensitive and each stream of reference data has an Effective Date set against it.
This allows reference data lookups to be performed using the date of the event to ensure the reference data that was actually effective at the time of the event is used.

Using reference data involves the following steps/processes:

* Ingesting the raw reference data into Stroom.
* Creating (and processing) a pipeline to transform the raw reference into `reference-data:2` format XML.
* Creating a reference loader pipeline with a Reference Data Filter element to load _cooked_ reference data into the reference data store.
* Adding reference pipeline/feeds to an XSLT Filter in your event pipeline.
* Adding the lookup call to the XSLT.
* Processing the raw events through the event pipeline.

The process of creating a reference data pipeline is described in the HOWTO linked at the top of this document.


## Reference Data Structure

A reference data entry essentially consists of the following:

* **Effective time** - The data/time that the entry was effective from, i.e the time the raw reference data was received.
* **Map name** - A unique name for the key/value map that the entry will be stored in.
  The name only needs to be unique within all map names that may be loaded within an XSLT Filter.
  In practice it makes sense to keep map names globally unique.
* **Key** - The text that will be used to lookup the value in the reference data map.
  Mutually exclusive with **Range**.
* **Range** - The inclusive range of integer keys that the entry applies to.
  Mutually exclusive with **Key**.
* **Value** - The value can either be simple text, e.g. an IP address, or an XML fragment that can be inserted into another XML document.
  XML values must be correctly namespaced.

The following is an example of some reference data that has been converted from its raw form into `reference-data:2` XML.
In this example the reference data contains three entries that each belong to a different map.
Two of the entries are simple text values and the last has an XML value.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<referenceData 
    xmlns="reference-data:2" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xmlns:stroom="stroom" 
    xmlns:evt="event-logging:3" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="reference-data:2 file://reference-data-v2.0.xsd" 
    version="2.0.1">

  <!-- A simple string value -->
  <reference>
    <map>FQDN_TO_IP</map>
    <key>stroomnode00.strmdev00.org</key>
    <value>
      <IPAddress>192.168.2.245</IPAddress>
    </value>
  </reference>

  <!-- A simple string value -->
  <reference>
    <map>IP_TO_FQDN</map>
    <key>192.168.2.245</key>
    <value>
      <HostName>stroomnode00.strmdev00.org</HostName>
    </value>
  </reference>

  <!-- A key range -->
  <reference>
    <map>USER_ID_TO_COUNTRY_CODE</map>
    <range>
      <from>1</from>
      <to>1000</to>
    </range>
    <value>GBR</value>
  </reference>

  <!-- An XML fragment value -->
  <reference>
    <map>FQDN_TO_LOC</map>
    <key>stroomnode00.strmdev00.org</key>
    <value>
      <evt:Location>
        <evt:Country>GBR</evt:Country>
        <evt:Site>Bristol-S00</evt:Site>
        <evt:Building>GZero</evt:Building>
        <evt:Room>R00</evt:Room>
        <evt:TimeZone>+00:00/+01:00</evt:TimeZone>
      </evt:Location>
    </value>
  </reference>
</referenceData>
```


### Reference Data Namespaces

When XML reference data values are created, as in the example XML above, the XML values must be qualified with a namespace to distinguish them from the `reference-data:2` XML that surrounds them.
In the above example the XML fragment will become as follows when injected into an event:

``` xml
      <evt:Location xmlns:evt="event-logging:3" >
        <evt:Country>GBR</evt:Country>
        <evt:Site>Bristol-S00</evt:Site>
        <evt:Building>GZero</evt:Building>
        <evt:Room>R00</evt:Room>
        <evt:TimeZone>+00:00/+01:00</evt:TimeZone>
      </evt:Location>
```

Even if `evt` is already declared in the XML being injected into it, if it has been declared for the reference fragment then it will be explicitly declared in the destination.
While duplicate namespacing may appear odd it is valid XML.

The namespacing can also be achieved like this:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<referenceData 
    xmlns="reference-data:2" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xmlns:stroom="stroom" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="reference-data:2 file://reference-data-v2.0.xsd" 
    version="2.0.1">

  <!-- An XML value -->
  <reference>
    <map>FQDN_TO_LOC</map>
    <key>stroomnode00.strmdev00.org</key>
    <value>
      <Location xmlns="event-logging:3">
        <Country>GBR</Country>
        <Site>Bristol-S00</Site>
        <Building>GZero</Building>
        <Room>R00</Room>
        <TimeZone>+00:00/+01:00</TimeZone>
      </Location>
    </value>
  </reference>
</referenceData>
```

This reference data will be injected into event XML exactly as it, i.e.:

``` xml
      <Location xmlns="event-logging:3">
        <Country>GBR</Country>
        <Site>Bristol-S00</Site>
        <Building>GZero</Building>
        <Room>R00</Room>
        <TimeZone>+00:00/+01:00</TimeZone>
      </Location>
```


## Reference Data Storage

Reference data is stored in two different places on a Stroom node.
All reference data is only visible to the node where it is located.
Each node that is performing reference data lookups will need to load and store its own reference data.
While this will result in duplicate data being held by nodes it makes the storage of reference data and its subsequent lookup very performant.


### On-Heap Store

The On-Heap store is the reference data store that is held in memory in the Java Heap.
This store is volatile and will be lost on shut down of the node.
The On-Heap store is only used for storage of context data.


### Off-Heap Store

The Off-Heap store is the reference data store that is held in memory outside of the Java Heap and is persisted to to local disk.
As the store is also persisted to local disk it means the reference data will survive the shutdown of the stroom instance.
Storing the data off-heap means Stroom can run with a much smaller Java Heap size.

The Off-Heap store is based on the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB).
LMDB makes use of the Linux page cache to ensure that hot portions of the reference data are held in the page cache (making use of all available free memory).
Infrequently used portions of the reference data will be evicted from the page cache by the Operating System.
Given that LMDB utilises the page cache for holding reference data in memory the more free memory the host has the better as there will be less shifting of pages in/out of the OS page cache.
When storing large amounts of data you may experience the OS reporting very little free memory as a large amount will be in use by the page cache.
This is not an issue as the OS will evict pages when memory is needed for other applications, e.g. the Java Heap.


#### Local Disk

The Off-Heap store is intended to be located on local disk on the Stroom node.
The location of the store is set using the property `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.localDir`.
Using LMDB on remote storage is NOT advised, see http://www.lmdb.tech/doc.
Using the fastest storage (i.g. fast SSDs) is advised to reduce load times and lookups of data that is not in memory.

{{% warning %}}
If you are running stroom on AWS EC2 instances then you will need to attach some local instance storage to the host, e.g. SSD, to use for the reference data store.
In tests EBS storage was found to be VERY slow.

It should be noted that AWS instance storage is not persistent between instance stops, terminations and hardware failure.
However any loss of the reference data store will mean that the next time Stroom boots a new store will be created and reference data will be loaded on demand as normal.
{{% /warning %}}


#### Transactions

LMDB is a transactional database with ACID semantics.
All interaction with LMDB is done within a read or write transaction.
There can only be one write transaction at a time so if there are a number of concurrent reference data loads then they will have to wait in line.

Read transactions, i.e. lookups, are not blocked by each other but may be blocked by a write transaction depending on the value of the system property `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.lmdb.readerBlockedByWriter`.
LMDB can operate such that readers are not blocked by writers but if there is an open read transaction while a write transaction is writing data to the store then it is unable to make use of free space (from previous deletes, see [Store Size & Compaction]({{< relref "#store-size--compaction" >}})) so will result in the store increasing in size.
If read transactions are likely while writes are taking place then this can lead to excessive growth of the store.
Setting  `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.lmdb.readerBlockedByWriter` to `true` will block all reads while a load is happening so any free space can be re-used, at the cost of making all lookups wait for the load to complete.
Use of this setting will depend on how likely it is that loads will clash with lookups and the store size should be monitored.


#### Read-Ahead Mode

When data is read from the store, if the data is not already in the page cache then it will be read from disk and added to the page cache by the OS.
Read-ahead is the process of speculatively reading ahead to load more pages into the page cache than were requested.
This is on the basis that future requests for data may need the pages speculatively read into memory as it is more efficient to read multiple pages at once.
If the reference data store is very large or is larger than the available memory then it is recommended to turn read-ahead off as the result will be to evict hot reference data from the page cache to make room for speculative pages that may not be needed.
It can be tuned off with the system property `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.readAheadEnabled`.


#### Key Size

When reference data is created care must be taken to ensure that the _Key_ used for each entry is less than 507 bytes.
For simple ASCII characters then this means less than 507 characters.
If non-ASCII characters are in the key then these will take up more than one byte per character so the length of the key in characters will be less.
This is a limitation inherent to LMDB.


#### Commit intervals

The property `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.maxPutsBeforeCommit` controls the number of entries that are put into the store between each commit.
As there can be only one transaction writing to the store at a time, committing periodically allows other process to jump in and make writes.
There is a trade off though as reducing the number of entries put between each commit can seriously affect performance.
For the fastest single process performance a value of `0` should be used which means it will not commit mid-load.
This however means all other processes wanting to write to the store will need to wait.
Low values (e.g. in the hundreds) mean very frequent commits so will hamper performance.


#### Cloning The Off Heap Store

If you are provisioning a new stroom node it is possible to copy the off heap store from another node.
Stroom should not be running on the node being copied from.
Simply copy the contents of `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.localDir` into the same configured location on the other node.
The new node will use the copied store and have access to its reference data.


#### Store Size & Compaction

Due to the way LMDB works the store can only grow in size, it will **never** shrink, even if reference data is deleted.
Deleted data frees up space for new writes to the store so will be reused but will never be freed back to the operating system. 
If there is a regular process of purging old data and adding new reference data then this should not be an issue as the new reference data will use the space made available by the purged data.

If store size becomes an issue then it is possible to _compact_ the store.
`lmdb-utils` is package that is available on some package managers and this has an `mdb_copy` command that can be used with the `-c` switch to copy the LMDB environment to a new one, compacting it in the process.
This should be done when Stroom is down to avoid writes happening to the store while the copy is happening.

The following is an example of how to compact the store assuming Stroom has been shut down first.

{{< command-line >}}
# Navigate to the 'stroom.pipeline.referenceData.localDir' directory
cd /some/path/to/reference_data
# Verify contents
ls
(out) data.mdb  lock.mdb
# Create a directory to write the compacted file to
mkdir compacted
# Run the compaction, writing the new data.mdb file to the new sub-dir
mdb_copy -c ./ ./compacted
# Delete the existing store
rm data.mdb lock.mdb
# Copy the compacted store back in (note a lock file gets created as needed)
mv compacted/data.mdb ./
# Remove the created directory
rmdir compacted
{{</ command-line >}}

Now you can re-start Stroom and it will use the new compacted store, creating a lock file for it.

The compaction process is fast.
A test compaction of a 4Gb store, compacted down to 1.6Gb took about 7s on non-flash HDD storage.

Alternatively, given that the store is essentially a cache and all data can be re-loaded another option is to delete the contents of `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.localDir` when Stroom is not running.
On boot Stroom will create a brand new empty store and reference data will be re-loaded as required.
This approach will result in all data having to be re-loaded so will slow lookups down until it has been loaded.


## The Loading Process

Reference data is loaded into the store on demand during the processing of a `stroom:lookup()` method call.
Reference data will only be loaded if it does not already exist in the store, however it is always loaded as a complete stream, rather than entry by entry.

The test for existence in the store is based on the following criteria:

* The UUID of the reference loader pipeline.
* The version of the reference loader pipeline.
* The Stream ID for the stream of reference data that has been deemed effective for the lookup.
* The Stream Number (in the case of multi part streams).

If a reference stream has already been loaded matching the above criteria then no additional load is required.

**IMPORTANT**: It should be noted that as the version of the reference data pipeline forms part of the criteria, if the reference loader pipeline is changed, for whatever reason, then this will invalidate ALL existing reference data associated with that reference loader pipeline.

Typically the reference loader pipeline is very static so this should not be an issue.

Standard practice is to convert raw reference data into `reference:2` XML on receipt using a pipeline separate to the reference loader.
The reference loader is then only concerned with reading cooked `reference:2` into the Reference Data Filter.

In instances where reference data streams are infrequently used it may be preferable to not convert the raw reference on receipt but instead to do it in the reference loader pipeline.


### Duplicate Keys

The Reference Data Filter pipeline element has a property `overrideExistingValues` which if set to _true_ means if an entry is found in an effective stream with the same key as an entry already loaded then it will overwrite the existing one.
Entries are loaded in the order they are found in the `reference:2` XML document.
If set to _false_ then the existing entry will be kept.
If `warnOnDuplicateKeys` is set to _true_ then a warning will be logged for any duplicate keys, whether an overwrite happens or not.


### Value De-Duplication

Only unique values are held in the store to reduce the storage footprint.
This is useful given that typically, reference data updates may be received daily and each one is a full snapshot of the whole reference data.
As a result this can mean many copies of the same value being loaded into the store.
The store will only hold the first instance of duplicate values.


## Querying the Reference Data Store

The reference data store can be queried within a Dashboard in Stroom by selecting `Reference Data Store` in the data source selection pop-up.
Querying the store is currently an experimental feature and is mostly intended for use in fault finding.
Given the localised nature of the reference data store the dashboard can currently only query the store on the node that the user interface is being served from.
In a multi-node environment where some nodes are UI only and most are processing only, the UI nodes will have no reference data in their store.


## Purging Old Reference Data

Reference data loading and purging is done at the level of a reference stream.
Whenever a reference lookup is performed the last accessed time of the reference stream in the store is checked.
If it is older than one hour then it will be updated to the current time.
This last access time is used to determine reference streams that are no longer in active use and thus can be purged.

The Stroom job _Ref Data Off-heap Store Purge_ is used to perform the purge operation on the Off-Heap reference data store.
No purge is required for the On-Heap store as that only holds transient data.
When the purge job is run it checks the time since each reference stream was accessed against the purge cut-off age.
The purge age is configured via the property `stroom.pipeline.referenceData.purgeAge`.
It is advised to schedule this job for quiet times when it is unlikely to conflict with reference loading operations as they will fight for access to the single write transaction.


## Lookups

Lookups are performed in XSLT Filters using the XSLT functions.
In order to perform a lookup one or more reference feeds must be specified on the XSLT Filter pipeline element.
Each reference feed is specified along with a reference loader pipeline that will ingest the specified feed (optional convert it into `reference:2` XML if it is not already) and pass it into a Reference Data Filter pipeline element.


### Reference Feeds & Loaders

In the XSLT Filter pipeline element multiple combinations of feed and reference loader pipeline can be specified.
There must be at least one in order to perform lookups.
If there are multiple then when a lookup is called for a given time, the effective stream for each feed/loader combination is determined.
The effective stream for each feed/loader combination will be loaded into the store, unless it is already present.

When the actual lookup is performed Stroom will try to find the key in each of the effective streams that have been loaded and that contain the map in the lookup call.
If the lookup is unsuccessful in the effective stream for the first feed/loader combination then it will try the next, and so on until it has tried all of them.
For this reason if you have multiple feed/loader combinations then order is important.
It is possible for multiple effective streams to contain the same map/key so a feed/loader combination higher up the list will trump one lower down with the same map/key.
Also if you have some lookups that may not return a value and others that should always return a value then the feed/loader for the latter should be higher up the list so it is searched first.


### Effective Streams

Reference data lookups have the concept of _Effective Streams_.
An effective stream is the most recent stream for a given {{< glossary "Feed" >}} that has an _effective date_ that is less than or equal to the date used for the lookup.
When performing a lookup, Stroom will search the stream store to find all the effective streams in a time bucket that surrounds the lookup time.
These sets of effective streams are cached so if a new reference stream is created it will not be used until the cached set has expired.
To rectify this you can clear the cache `Reference Data - Effective Stream Cache` on the Caches screen accessed from:

{{< stroom-menu "Monitoring" "Caches" >}}


### Standard Key/Value Lookups

Standard key/value lookups consist of a simple string key and a value that is either a simple string or an XML fragment.
Standard lookups are performed using the various forms of the [`stroom:lookup()`]({{< relref "./xslt/xslt-functions.md#lookup" >}}) XSLT function.

{{% note %}}
If the key is not found and the key is an integer then it will attempt a range lookup using the same key.
This is to allow for maps that contain a mixture of key/value pairs and range/value pairs.
{{% /note %}}


### Range Lookups

Range lookups consist of a key that is an integer and a value that is either a simple string or an XML fragment.
For more detail on range lookups see the XSLT function [`stroom:lookup()`]({{< relref "./xslt/xslt-functions.md#range-lookups" >}}).

{{% note %}}
The lookup will initially look for a single key that matches the lookup key.
If an exact match is not found then it will look for a range that contains the key.
This is to allow for maps that contain a mixture of key/value pairs and range/value pairs.
{{% /note %}}


### Nested Map Lookups

Nested map lookups involve chaining a number of lookups with the value of each map being used as the key for the next.
For more detail on nested lookups see the XSLT function [`stroom:lookup()`]({{< relref "./xslt/xslt-functions.md#nested-maps" >}}).


### Bitmap Lookups

A bitmap lookup is a special kind of lookup that actually performs a lookup for each enabled bit position of the passed bitmap value.
For more detail on bitmap lookups see the XSLT function [`stroom:bitmap-lookup()`]({{< relref "./xslt/xslt-functions.md#bitmap-lookup" >}}).

Values can either be a simple string or an XML fragment.


### Context data lookups

Some event streams have a Context stream associated with them.
Context streams allow the system sending the events to Stroom to supply an additional stream of data that provides context to the raw event stream.
This can be useful when the system sending the events has no control over the event content but needs to supply additional information.
The context stream can be used in lookups as a reference source to decorate events on receipt.
Context reference data is specific to a single event stream so is transient in nature, therefore the On Heap Store is used to hold it for the duration of the event stream processing only.

Typically the reference loader for a context stream will include a translation step to convert the raw context data into `reference:2` XML.
