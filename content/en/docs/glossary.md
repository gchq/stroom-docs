  Glossary of common words and terms used in Stroom.

---

## Account

Refers to a user account in Stroom's internal {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}}.

See [User Accounts]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/security/user-accounts" >}}) for more detail.


## API

Application Programming Interface.
An interface that one system can present so other systems can use it to communicate.
Stroom has a number of APIs, e.g. its many {{< external-link "REST" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" >}} APIs and its `/datafeed` interface for data receipt.


## API Key

A {{< glossary "Token" >}} created by Stroom's internal {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}} for authenticating with the {{< glossary "API" >}}.
It is an encrypted string that contains details of the user and the expiration date of the token.
Possession of a valid API Key for a user account means that you can do anything that the user can do in the user interface via the API.
API Keys should therefore be protected carefully and treated like a password.
If you are using an external {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}} then tokens for use with the {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}} are generated by the external {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}}.


## Application Permission

This is a permission that is not specific to a single document.
It applies to all documents or is not related to documents in any way.

Application permissions are generally associated with a screen or functional area of the Stroom application.
A lot of the application permissions tend to be more applicable to system administrator but allow fine grained control of the different functional areas in Stroom so these functions can be devolved to other users.
Examples of application permissions are `Manage Users`, `Pipeline Stepping` and `Data - View`.

See [Application Permissions]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/security/app-permissions" >}}) for more detail.


## Byte Order Mark

A special Unicode character at the start of a text stream that indicates the byte order (or endianness) of the stream.

See [Byte Order Mark]({{< relref "docs/sending-data/data-formats/character-encoding" >}}) for more detail.


## Character Encoding

{{< external-link "Character encoding" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding" >}} is the means of encoding character data (i.e. text) into binary form.
Therefore to decode character date from a stream of bytes, the character encoding must be known (or guessed).

Common examples of character encodings are `ASCII`, `UTF-8` and `UTF-16`.

Each {{< glossary "feed" >}} has a defined character encoding for the data and {{< glossary "context data" "context">}}.
This allows Stroom to decode the data sent into that Feed.


## Condition

A Condition in an query expression term, e.g. `=`, `>`, `in`, etc.


## Content

Content in Stroom typically means the documents/entities created Stroom and as seen in the explorer tree.
Content can be created/modified by Stroom users and imported/exported for sharing between different Stroom instances.


## Context Data

This is an additional stream of contextual data that is sent along side the main event stream.
It provides a means for the sending system to send additional data that relates only to the event stream it is sent alongside.
This can be useful where the sending system has no control over the data in the event stream and the event stream does contain contextual information such as what machine it is running on or the location of that machine.

The contextual information (such as hostname, FQDN, physical location, etc.) can be sent in a Context Stream so that the two can be combined together during pipeline processing using `stroom:lookup()`.

See [Context Data]({{< relref "context-data" >}}), [Stream Concepts]({{< relref "user-guide/concepts" >}}) and [`stroom:lookup()`]({{< relref "user-guide/pipelines/xslt/xslt-functions#lookup" >}}) for more details.


## Cron

{{< external-link "cron" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" >}} is a command line utility found on most linux/unix systems that is used for scheduling background tasks.
Cron expressions (or variants of them) are widely used in other schedulers.

Stroom uses a scheduler called Quartz which supports cron expressions for scheduling.
The full details of the cron syntax supported by Quartz can be found {{< external-link "here" "https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html" >}}.

See [Cron Syntax]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/cron" >}}) for more detail.


## CSV

**C**omma **S**eparated **V**alues is a file format with typically one record per line and fields delimited by a `,`.
Field may be optionally enclosed with double quotes, though there is no fixed standard for CSV data, particularly when it comes to escaping of double quotes and/or commas.


## Dashboard

A Dashboard is a configurable entity for querying one or more {{< glossary "Data Source" "Data Sources">}} and displaying the results as a table, a visualisation or some other form.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/search/dashboards" >}}) for more detail.


## Data Source

The source of data for a {{< glossary "Query" >}}, e.g. a Lucene based {{< glossary "Index" >}}, a SQL Statistics Data source, etc.
There are three types of Data source:

* {{< stroom-icon "document/Index.svg" "Index" >}} Lucene based search index data sources.
* {{< stroom-icon "document/StatisticStore.svg" "SQL Statistics" >}} Stroom's SQL Statistics data sources.
* {{< stroom-icon "document/searchable.svg" "Searchable" >}} Searchable data sources for searching the internals of Stroom.

A data source will have a {{< glossary "DocRef" >}} to identify it and will define the set of {{< glossary "Field" "Fields" >}} that it presents.
Each Field will have:
* A name
* A set of {{< glossary "Condition" "Conditions" >}} that it supports.
  E.g. a `Feed` field would likely support `is` but not `>`.
* A flag to indicate if it is queryable or not.
  I.e. a queryable field could be referenced in the query expression tree and in a {{< glossary "Dashboard" >}} table, but a non-queryable field could only be referenced in the Dashboard table.


## Data Splitter

Data Splitter is a {{< glossary "pipeline" >}} element for converting text data (e.g. CSV, fixed width, delimited, multi-line) into XML for onward processing.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/data-splitter" >}}) or the [Pipeline Element Reference]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/pipeline-elements#dsparser" >}}) for more detail.


## Dictionary

A entity for storing static content, e.g. lists of terms for use in a query with the `in dictionary` condition.
They can also be used to hold arbitrary text for use in {{< glossary "XSLT" "XSLTs" >}} with the [dictionary()]({{< relref "user-guide/pipelines/xslt/xslt-functions#dictionary" >}})


## DocRef

A DocRef is an identifier used to identify most documents/entities in Stroom, e.g. An XSLT will have a DocRef.
It is comprised of the following parts:

* {{< glossary "UUID" >}} - A Universally Unique Identifier to uniquely identify the document/entity.
* Type - The type of the document/entity, e.g. `Index`, `XSLT`, `Dashboard`, etc.
* Name - The name given to the document/entity.

DocRefs are used heavily in the [REST API]({{< relref "user-guide/api" >}}) for identifying the document/entity to be acted on.


## Document

Typically refers to an item that can be created in the Explorer Tree, e.g. a Feed, a Pipeline, a Dashboard, etc. May also be known as an {{< glossary "Entity" >}}.


## Document Permission

Document permissions control the access that users and/or groups have to a {{< glossary "Document" >}}.

See the [Document Permissions]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/security/doc-permissions" >}}) for more detail.


## Elasticsearch

{{< external-link "Elasticsearch" "https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/" >}} is an Open Source and commercial search index product.
Stroom can be connected to one or more Elasticsearch clusters so that event indexing and search is handled by Elasticsearch rather than internally.


## Entity

Typically refers to an item that can be created in the Explorer Tree, e.g. a Feed, a Pipeline, a Dashboard, etc. May also be known as a {{< glossary "Document" >}}.


## Event

An event is a single auditable event, e.g. a user logging in to a system.
A {{< glossary "Stream " >}} typically contains multiple events.

In a {{< glossary "Raw Stream" >}} an event is typically represented as block of XML or JSON, a single line for CSV data.
In an {{< glossary "Events" >}} {{< glossary "Stream" >}} an event is identified by its `Event ID` which its position in that stream (as a one-based number).
The `Event ID` combined with a `Stream ID` provide a unique identifier for an event within a Stroom instance.


## Events

This is a {{< glossary "Stream Type" >}} in Stroom.
An _Events_ stream consists of processed/cooked data that has been demarcated into individual Events.
Typically in Stroom an _Events_ stream will contain data conforming to the {{< external-link "event-logging XML Schema" "https://github.com/gchq/event-logging-schema" >}} which provides a normalised form for all {{< glossary "Raw Events" >}} to be transformed into.


## Explorer Tree

The left hand navigation tree.
The Explorer Tree is used for finding, opening, creating, renaming, copying, moving and deleting {{< glossary "Entity" "Entities" >}}.
It can also be used to control the access permissions of entities and folders.
The tree can be filtered using the quick filter, see [Finging Things]({{< relref "finding-things.md" >}}) for more details.


## Expression Tree

A tree of expression terms that each evaluate to a boolean (True/False) value.
Terms can be grouped together within an expression operator (AND, OR, NOT).
For example:

```text
AND (
  Feed is CSV_FEED
  Type = Raw Events
)
```
Expression Trees are used in {{< glossary "Processor Filter" "Processor Filters" >}} and {{< glossary "Query" >}} expressions.

See also [Expression functions]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/expressions" >}}).


## Feed

A Feed is means of organising and categorising data in Stroom.
A Feed contains multiple {{< glossary "stream" "Streams" >}} of data that have been ingested into Stroom or output by a {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}}.
Typically a Feed will contain {{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}} of data that are all from one system and have a common data format.


## Field

A named data Field within some form of record or entity, and where each Field can have an associated value.
In Stroom Fields can be the Fields in an {{< glossary "Index" >}} (or other queryable {{< glossary "Datasource" >}}) or the fields of {{< glossary "Meta Data" >}} associated with a {{< glossary "Stream" >}}, e.g. Stream ID, {{< glossary "Feed" >}}, creation time, etc.


## Filter (Processor)

See {{< glossary "Processor Filter" >}}.


## FQDN

The {{< external-link "Fully Qualified Domain Name" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name" >}} of a device, i.e. `server57.some.domain.com`.


## Group (Users)

A named group of users to which application and document permissions can be assigned.
Users can belong to multiple groups.
A Group can belong to multiple groups.
Groups allow permissions to be assigned to the group such that members of that group inherit those permissions.

See [Users and Groups]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/security/users-and-groups" >}}) for more detail.


## Identity Provider (IDP)

An _Identity Provider_ is a system or service that can authenticate a user and assert their identity.
_Identity providers_ can support single sign on (SSO), which allows the user to sign in once to the _Identity Provider_ so they are then authenticated to all systems using that IDP.
Examples of identity providers are Google, Cognito, KeyCloack and Microsoft Azure/Entra AD.
Stroom has its own built in IDP or can be configured to use a 3rd party IDP.


## ISO8601

This is an international standard for representing dates, times and durations.
By default Stroom displays date/times in ISO8601.
Valid examples of ISO8601 dates/times are:

```text
2010-01-01T23:59Z
2010-01-01T23:59:59Z
2010-01-01T23:59:59.123Z
2010-01-01T23:59:59+02:00
2010-01-01T23:59:59.123+02
```

See {{< external-link "ISO_8601" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" >}} for more detail.


## JSON

**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation is a file/data format for storing/transmitting structured data.
It has similarities to XML, is less verbose, but is more simplistic.
Stroom accepts data in JSON format and can output to JSON.

See {{< external-link "Wikipedia" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" >}} for details.


## Markdown

*Markdown* is a markup language for creating formatted text using a simple text editor.
Stroom uses the {{< external-link "Showdown" "https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown's-Markdown-syntax" >}} markdown converter to render users' markdown content into formatted text.

{{% note %}}
Markdown is a somewhat loose standard so different markdown processors support different amounts of markdown syntax.
For a definitive guide to the syntax supported in Stroom, see the above link.
{{% /note %}}


## Namespace

In Stroom _Namespace_ typically refers to an {{< external-link "XML Namespace" "https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_namespaces.asp" >}}.
Namespaces are used in XML to distinguish different elements, e.g. where an {{< glossary "XSLT" >}} is transforming XML in the `records:2` _Namespace_ into XML in the `event-logging:3` _Namespace_.

An XSLT will define short aliases for _Namespaces_ to make them easier to reference within the XSLT document, e.g. in this example the aliases `stroom`, `evt`, `xsl`, `xsi`:

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet
  xmlns="event-logging:3"
  xpath-default-namespace="records:2"
  xmlns:stroom="stroom"
  xmlns:evt="event-logging:3"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
  version="2.0">
```


## Parser

A Parser is a {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}} element for parsing {{< glossary "Raw Events" >}} into a structured form.
For example the Data Splitter Parser that parses text data into {{< glossary "Records" >}} and {{< glossary "Field" "Fields">}}.

See the [Pipeline Element Reference]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/pipeline-elements#parser" >}}) for details.


## Pipeline

A Pipeline is an entity that is constructed to take a single input of stream data and process/transform it with one or more outputs.
A Pipeline can have many elements within it to read, process or transform the data flowing through it.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/pipelines" >}}) for more detail.


## Pipeline Element

An element within a {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}} that performs some action on the data flowing through it.

See the [Pipeline Element Reference]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/pipeline-elements" >}}) for more detail.


## Processor

A Processor belongs to a {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}}.
It controls the processing of data through its parent Pipeline.
The Processor can be enabled/disabled to enable/disable the processing of data through the Pipeline.
A processor will have one or more {{< glossary "Processor Filter" "Processor Filters" >}} associated with it.


## Processor Filter

A Processor Filter consists of an expression tree to select which {{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}} to process through its parent {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}}.
For example a typical Processor Filter would have an Expression Tree that selected all Streams of type _Raw Events_ in a particular {{< glossary "Feed" >}}.
A filter could also select a single Stream by its ID, e.g. when {{< glossary "Re-Processing" >}} a Stream.
The filter is used to find Streams to process through the {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}} associated with the Processor Filter.
A Pipeline can have multiple Processor Filters.
Filters can be enabled/disabled independently of their parent Processor to control processing.


## Property

A configuration Property for configuring Stroom.
Properties can be set via in the user interface or via the `config.yml` configuration file.

See [Properties]({{< relref "Properties" >}}) for more detail.


## Query

The search Query in a {{< glossary "Dashboard" >}} that selects the data to display.
The Query is constructed using an {{< glossary "Expression Tree" >}} of terms.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "user-guide/search/dashboards/queries" >}}) for more detail.


## Raw Events

This is a {{< glossary "Stream Type" >}} used for {{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}} received by Stroom.
Streams received by Stroom will be in a variety of text formats (CSV, delimited, fixed width, XML, JSON, etc.).
Until they have been processed by a pipeline they are essentially just unstructured character data with no concept of what is a record/event.
A {{< glossary "Parser" >}} in a pipeline is required to provide the demarcation between records/events.


## Re-Processing

The act of repeating the processing of a set of input data ({{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}}) that have already been processed at least once.
Re-Processing can be done for an individual Stream or multiple Streams using a {{< glossary "Processor Filter" >}}.


## Records

This is a {{< glossary "Stream Type" >}} for {{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}} containing data conforming to the {{< external-link "records:2 XML Schema" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom-content/blob/master/source/core-xml-schemas/stroomContent/XML%20Schemas/records/records_v2_0.XMLSchema.47f062d9-8191-4535-b35b-74c6f020320f.data.xsd" >}}.
It also refers more generally to XML conforming to the `records:2` XML Schema which is used in a number of places in Stroom, including as the output format for the {{< element "DSParser" >}} and input for the {{< element "IndexingFilter" >}}.


## Searchable

A _Searchable_ is the term given the special searchable data sources that appear at the root of the explorer tree picker when selecting a data source.
These data sources are special internal data sources that are not user managed content, unlike an {{< glossary "Index" >}}.
They provide the means to search various aspects of Stroom's internals, such as the _Meta Store_ or _Processor Tasks_.


## Search Extraction

The process of extracting un-indexed {{< glossary "Field" >}} values from the source {{< glossary "Event" >}}/Record to be used in search results.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/search/search-extraction" >}}) for more detail.


## Stream

A Stream is the unit of data that Stroom works with and will typically contain many {{< glossary "Event" "Events" >}}.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/concepts/streams" >}}) for more detail.


## Stream Type

All {{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}} must have an Stream Type.
The list of Stream Types is configured using the {{< glossary "Property" >}} `stroom.data.meta.metaTypes`.
Additional Stream Types can be added however the list of Stream Types must include the following built-in types: 

* Context
* Error
* {{< glossary "Events" >}}
* Meta
* {{< glossary "Raw Events" >}}
* Raw Reference
* Reference

Some Stream Types, such as `Meta` and `Context` only exist as [child streams]({{< relref "user-guide/concepts/streams#child-stream-types" >}}) within another Stream.


## StroomQL

**Stroom** **Q**uery **L**anguage is Stroom's own query language.
It has similarities with Structured Query Language (SQL) as used in databases.
StroomQL is sometimes referred to as _sQL_ to distinguish it from _SQL_.

See [Stroom Query Language]({{< relref "user-guide/search/queries/stroom-query-language" >}})


## Stepper

The Stepper is a tool in Stroom for developing and debugging a {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}}.
It allows the user to simulate passing a {{< glossary "Stream" >}} through a pipeline with the ability to _step_ from one record/event to the next or to jump to records/events based on filter criteria.
The parsers and translations can be edited while in the Stepper with the element output updating to show the effect of the change.
The stepper will not write data to the file system or stream stores.


## Token

Typically refers to an authentication token that may be used for user authentication or as an {{< glossary "Api Key" >}}.
Tokens are {{< external-link "JSON Web Tokens (JWT)" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token" >}} that set in the HTTP header `Authorization` with a value of the form `Bearer TOKEN_GOES_HERE`.
Tokens are associated with a Stroom User so have the same or less permissions than that user.
Tokens also have an expiry time after which they will no longer work.


## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS is the evolution of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and refers to the encryption of traffic between client and server.
TLS is typically used in Stroom for communications between Stroom-Proxy and Stroom, between Stroom nodes and when communicating with external systems (e.g. an Elasticsearch cluster of a HttpPostFilter destination).


## Tracker

A Tracker is associated with a {{< glossary "Processor Filter" >}} and keeps track of the {{< glossary "Stream" "Streams" >}} that the Processor Filter has already processed.


## Unix Epoch

The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1st January 1970.
Some timestamps in Stroom are represented as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch, e.g. `1738331628276`, and may be referred to as _epoch ms_ or _epoch milliseconds_.


## User

Refers to a Stroom User that is linked to either an {{< glossary "Account" >}} in Stroom's internal {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}} or a user account in an external {{< glossary "identity provider idp" "Identity Provider">}}.
A Stroom User is only concerned with authorisation (i.e. application/document permissions and group memberships), and not authentication.

See [Users and Groups]({{< relref "docs/user-guide/security/users-and-groups" >}}) for more detail.


## UTC

{{< external-link "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time" >}}, also known as Zulu time, is the international standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
It is essentially a successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
UTC has the timezone offset of `+00:00`.
All international time zones are relative to UTC.

Stroom currently works internally in UTC, though it is possible to change the display time zone via User Preferences to display times in another timezone.


## UUID 

A Universally Unique Identifier for uniquely identifying something.
UUIDs are used as the identifier in {{< glossary "DocRef" "DocRefs" >}}.
An example of a UUID is `4ffeb895-53c9-40d6-bf33-3ef025401ad3`.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "user-guide/search/dashboards" >}}) for more detail.


## Visualisation

A document comprising some Javascript code for visualising data, e.g. pie charts, heat maps, line graphs etc.
Visualisations are not baked into Stroom, they are content, so can be created/modified/shared by Stroom users.


## Volume

In Stroom a Volume is a logical storage area that Stroom can write data to.
Volumes are associated with a path on a file system that can either be local to the Stroom node or on a shared file system.
Stroom has two types of Volume; Index Volumes and Data Volumes.

* _Index Volume_ - Where the Lucene Index Shards are written to.
  An Index Volume must belong to a {{< glossary "Volume Group" >}}.
* _Data Volume_ - Where streams are written to.
  When writing {{< glossary "Stream" >}} data Stroom will pick a data volume to using a volume selector as configured by the {{< glossary "Property" >}} `stroom.data.filesystemVolume.volumeSelector`.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "user-guide/volumes" >}}) for more detail.


## Volume Group

A Volume Group is a collection of one or more Index Volumes.
Index volumes must belong to a volume group and Indexes are configured to write to a particular Volume Group.
When Stroom is write data to a Volume Group it will choose which if the Volumes in the group to write to using a volume selector as configured by the {{< glossary "Property" >}} `stroom.volumes.volumeSelector`.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "user-guide/volumes" >}}) for more detail.


## XML

E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage is a markup language for storing/transmitting structured data.
It is the working format for most {{< glossary "Pipeline" >}} processing in Stroom and is the standard normalised format for event data.


## XML Schema

{{< external-link "XML Schema" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema" >}} is a language used to define the permitted structure of an XML document.
An XML Schema can be used to validate an XML document to ensure it conforms to that schema such that onward processing of the XML document can be done with confidence that the document is correct.

The {{< external-link "event-logging XML Schema" "https://github.com/gchq/event-logging-schema" >}} is an example of an XML Schema.


## XPath

{{< external-link "XPath" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath" >}} is an expression language for selecting a node or nodes in an XML document.
It is used heavily in {{< glossary "XSLT" >}} to define the match criteria for templates and to select values.


## XSLT

E**x**tensible **S**tylesheet **L**anguage **T**ransformations is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents.
XSLTs are the primary means of transforming data in Stroom.
All data is converted into a basic form of XML and then XSLTs are used to decorate and transform it into a common form.
XSLTs are also used to transform XML {{< glossary "Events" >}} data into non-XML forms or XML with a different schema for indexing, statistics or for sending to other systems.

See the [User Guide]({{< relref "user-guide/pipelines/xslt" >}}) for more detail.
