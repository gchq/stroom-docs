## Getting and Running Stroom

For this quick start you want a simple single-node Stroom. 
You will want to follow [these instructions]({{< relref "docs/install-guide/single-node-docker" >}}) for setting up a single node _stroom_core_test_ stack installation in the simplest way.

## First look

Once you log into Stroom you will see that it comes pre-loaded with some content as can be seen in the left hand explorer pane.
The _stroom_core_test_ stack includes _stroom-log-sender_ to forward the application, user and request logs generated by Stroom, Stroom Proxy and Nginx to Stroom.
This stack is pre-configured to have processing enabled on boot so Stroom will start receiving logs and processing them.

Double click on the _System_ entry {{< stroom-icon "oo.svg" "System" >}} in the explorer tree to see all raw and processed streams.

So now we've got Stroom up and running lets [get data into Stroom]({{< relref "./feed" >}})
