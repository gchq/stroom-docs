<!--
To build this list run diff_changelog.sh in the root of the stroom repo.
E.g. ./diff_changelog.sh 7.4 7.5 | sed -E -e 's/^/\n/' -e 's|Issue \*\*#([0-9]+)\*\*|Issue **{{< external-link "#\1" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/\1" >}}**|g'

OR, if you use Vim use this command to read it straight into this buffer
(Hash '#' needs to be escaped with '\' to stop vim replacing it with the current file path)
:r !../stroom_v7_10/diff_changelog.sh 7.9 7.10 | sed -E -e 's/^/\n/' -e 's|Issue \*\*\#([0-9]+)\*\*|Issue **{{< external-link "\#\1" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/\1" >}}**|g'

## Features and Changes

* Change the resource store to not rely on sessions. Resources are now linked to a user.

* Add `ReceiptId` to the INFO message on data receipt.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5047" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5047" >}}** : Replace the property `stroom.security.authentication.openid.validateAudience` with `stroom.security.authentication.openid.allowedAudiences` (defaults to empty) and `stroom.security.authentication.openid.audienceClaimRequired` (defaults to false). If the IDP is known to provide the `aud` claim (often populated with the `clientId`) then set `allowedAudiences` to contain that value and set `audienceClaimRequired` to `true`.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5068" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5068" >}}** : Add the config prop `stroom.security.authentication.openId.fullNameClaimTemplate` to allow the user's full name to be formed from a template containing a mixture of static text and claim variables, e.g. `${firstName} ${lastName}`. Unknown variables are replaced with an empty string. Default is `${name}`.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5066" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5066" >}}** : Change template syntax of `openid.publicKeyUriPattern` prop from positional variables (`{}`) to named variables (`${awsRegion}`). Default value has changed to `https://public-keys.auth.elb.${awsRegion}.amazonaws.com/${keyId}`. If this prop has been explicitly set, its value will need to be changed to named variables.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5030" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5030" >}}** : Add new property `.receive.x509CertificateDnFormat` to stroom and proxy to allow extraction of CNs from DNs in legacy `OPEN_SSL` format. The new property defaults to `LDAP`, which means no change to behaviour if left as is.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5007" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5007" >}}** : Add ceilingTime() and floorTime().

* Issue **{{< external-link "#3083" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3083" >}}** : Allow data() table function to show the Info pane.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4965" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4965" >}}** : Add dashboard screen to show current selection parameters.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4496" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4496" >}}** : Add parse-dateTime xslt function.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4496" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4496" >}}** : Add format-dateTime xslt function.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4969" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4969" >}}** : Add a checkbox to Content Templates edit screen to make it copy (and re-map) any xslt/textConverter docs in the inherited pipeline.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4726" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4726" >}}** : Get meta for parent stream.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4900" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4900" >}}** : Add histogram and metric stores to Plan B.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#3861" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3861" >}}** : Add Shard Id, Index Version to Index Shards searchable.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4112" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4112" >}}** : Allow use of Capture groups in the decode() function result.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#3955" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3955" >}}** : Add case expression function.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4484" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4484" >}}** : Change selection handling to use fully qualified keys.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4742" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4742" >}}** : Allow embedded queries to be copies rather than references.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#4894" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4894" >}}** : Plan B query without snapshots.

## Bug Fixes

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5027" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5027" >}}** : Allow users to choose run as user for processing.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5137" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5137" >}}** : Fix how proxy adds HTTP headers when sending downstream. It now only adds received meta entries to the headers if they are on an allow list. This list is made up of a hard coded base list `accountId, accountName, classification, component, contextEncoding, contextFormat, encoding, environment, feed, format, guid, schema, schemaVersion, system, type` and is supplemented by the new config property `forwardHeadersAdditionalAllowSet` in the `forwardHttpDestinations` items.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5135" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5135" >}}** : Fix proxy multi part gzip handling.

* Uplift JDK to 21.0.8_9 in docker images and sdkmanrc.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5132" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5132" >}}** : Fix missing session when AWS ALB does the code flow.

* Fix the OpenID code flow to stop the session being lost after redirection back to the initiating URL.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5101" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5101" >}}** : Fix select-all filtering when doing a reprocess of everything in a folder. It no longer tries to re-process deleted items streams.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5115" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5115" >}}** : Use correct  header during proxy forward requests.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5121" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5121" >}}** : Proxy aggregation now keeps only common headers in aggregated data.

* Fix exception handling of DistributedTaskFetcher so it will restart after failure.

* Issue **{{< external-link "#5042" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/5042" >}}** : Allow the import of processor filters when the existing processor filter is in a logically deleted state.
