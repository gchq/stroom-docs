## Open ID Connect Authentication

Various minor changes to the way Open ID Connect authentication is performed.


### Audience Validation

Replace the property `stroom.security.authentication.openid.validateAudience` with `stroom.security.authentication.openid.allowedAudiences` (defaults to empty) and `stroom.security.authentication.openid.audienceClaimRequired` (defaults to false).
If the IDP is known to provide the `aud` claim (often populated with the `clientId`) then set `allowedAudiences` to contain that value and set `audienceClaimRequired` to `true`.


### User Full Name

Add the config prop `stroom.security.authentication.openId.fullNameClaimTemplate` to allow the user's full name to be formed from a template containing a mixture of static text and claim variables, e.g. `${firstName} ${lastName}`.
Unknown variables are replaced with an empty string. Default is `${name}`.

This provides full control over the source of the user's full name in stroom and allows it to be formed from multiple claims within the authentication token.


### AWS Integration

Change template syntax of `openid.publicKeyUriPattern` property from positional variables (`{}`) to named variables (`${awsRegion}`).
Default value has changed to `https://public-keys.auth.elb.${awsRegion}.amazonaws.com/${keyId}`.
If this property has been explicitly set in the config.yml or Properties screen, its value will need to be changed to use named variables instead.


### Certificate DN Format

Add new property `.receive.x509CertificateDnFormat` to stroom and proxy to allow extraction of CNs from DNs in legacy `OPEN_SSL` format.
The new property defaults to `LDAP`, which means no change to behaviour if left as is.


## Dashboard & StroomQL Functions

### `ceilingTime(..)` & `floorTime(...)`

Two new functions similar to the existing [`ceilingXXX`]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/expressions/date#ceiling-yearmonthdayhourminutesecond" >}}) and [`floorXXX`]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/expressions/date#floor-yearmonthdayhourminutesecond" >}}) functions, except that an arbitrary duration can be used.

For example, `floorTime($time, 'PT5m')` will floor the time to the latest time that is divisible by 5 minutes.


### `case(...)`

A `case` function has been added for performing simple `if...else if....else if.....end` type logic.
The function takes the arguments:

```
case(input, test1, result1, testN, resultN, otherwise)
```

This is equivalent to
```
if (input == test1) {
    return result1
} else if (input == testN) {
    return resultN
} else {
    return otherwise
}
```

See [case]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/expressions/logic#case" >}}) for details.


### `formatIECByteSize(...)`

A new function for converting an integer amount of bytes into an appropriate byte size unit, e.g. `1024` bytes becomes `1K`.
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) units with a base of `1024` rather than `1000` are used.

The function has three forms:

```text
formatIECByteSize(bytes)
formatIECByteSize(bytes, omitTrailingZeros)
formatIECByteSize(bytes, omitTrailingZeros, significantFigures)
```


### `formatMetricByteSize(...)`

A new function for converting an integer amount of bytes into an appropriate byte size unit, e.g. `1000` bytes becomes `1K`.
Metrix units with a base of `1000` rather than `1024` are used.

The function has three forms:

```text
formatMetricByteSize(bytes)
formatMetricByteSize(bytes, omitTrailingZeros)
formatMetricByteSize(bytes, omitTrailingZeros, significantFigures)
```


### `decode(...)`

The existing [`decode(...)`]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/expressions/string#decode" >}}) function has been changed so that you can use any capture groups in the regular expression patterns in the result arguments.
For example:

```clike
decode('TestString123','Test(.....)(123)','$1-$2','Nothing')
```

Which would output `String-123`.


### `data(...)`

The existing [`data(...)`]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/expressions/link#data" >}}) function has been changed so that you can display the stream info and metadata instead of the stream data by setting the `viewType` argument to a value of `info`.

For example:

```clike
data('View Cooked', ${StreamId}, 1, ${eventId}, null(), null(), null(), null(), 'info')
```


## Dashboard Embedded Queries

When creating an Embedded Query Dashboard pane, it is now possible to embed a copy of an existing query rather than embedding a reference to one.
This decouples the Dashboard from the original Query so the original Query can be changed without impacting the Dashboard.

The embedded Query can be edited via the menu on the Dashboard pane.


## Stroom XSLT Functions

### `parse-dateTime(...)`

A `parse-dateTime` function has been added with the following overloads:

```text
parse-dateTime(ISO8601 string)
parse-dateTime(string, pattern)
parse-dateTime(string, pattern, timezone)
```

This function will either parse a date/time string in {{< glossary "ISO8601" >}} standard date/time format or in a custom date/time format using the supplied pattern and optional timezone.

For details of the pattern syntax see [Custom Date Formats]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/dates#custom-date-formats" >}}).

All forms of the function return an `xs:dateTime` value for use by standard XSLT/XPath functions that can consume an `xs:dateTime` value.


### `format-dateTime(...)`

A `format-dateTime` function has been added with the following overloads:

```text
format-dateTime(DateTimeValue)
format-dateTime(DateTimeValue, pattern)
format-dateTime(DateTimeValue, pattern, timezone)
```

All three variants take an `xs:dateTime` value as the first argument.
If only one argument is supplied, the function will output the date/time as a standard {{< glossary "ISO8601" >}} format `xs:string`.
If two or more arguments are supplied then it will output the date/time formatted using the specified [pattern]({{< relref "docs/reference-section/dates#custom-date-formats" >}}) and optionally using the specified timezone.
If no timezone is supplied, the date/time is assumed to be in {{< glossary "UTC" >}}.


### Meta Functions

The following functions have been added for obtaining meta-data relating to the stream being processed or specified streams.

* `manifest()` - Returns manifest attributes for current stream
* `manifest-for-id(streamId)` - Returns manifest attributes for specified stream
* `meta-stream()` - Returns meta stream for current stream
* `meta-stream-for-id(streamId, partNo)` - Returns meta stream for specified stream and part no
* `parent-id()` - Gets parent ID for current stream
* `parent-for-id(streamId)` - Get parent Stream ID for specified stream


## Content Templates

When creating a content template of type `INHERIT_PIPELINE` it is now possible to tick a box so that any dependencies of the pipeline being inherited from (e.g. Data Splitter TextConverter documents or XsltFilter XSLT documents) will be copied as siblings of the generated Pipeline  {{< stroom-icon "document/Pipeline.svg" "title">}}.

This allows the Data Splitter or XSLT to be refined/populated for the new content.


### Index Shards Searchable

The _IndexShards_ {{< glossary "Searchable" >}} has been changed to add the fields `Shard Id` and `Index Version` to the list of available fields.

* `Shard Id` - This is the ID of the shard within the index.
* `Index Version` - This is the Lucene version that this index was created with.
  Currently Stroom supports two different versions of the Lucene search index.
