  Required actions and information relating to upgrading to Stroom version 7.11.
---

{{% warning %}}
Please read this section carefully in case any of it is relevant to your Stroom/Stroom-Proxy instance.
{{% /warning %}}


## Upgrade Path

You can upgrade to v7.11.x from any v7.x release that is older than the version being upgraded to.

If you want to upgrade to v7.11.x from v5.x or v6.x we recommend you do the following:

1. Upgrade v5.x to the latest patch release of v6.0.
1. Upgrade v6.x to the latest patch release of v7.0.
1. Upgrade v7.x to the latest patch release of v7.11.

{{% warning %}}
v7.11 **cannot** migrate content in legacy formats, i.e. content created in v5/v6.
You must therefore upgrade to v7.0.x first to migrate this content, before upgrading to v7.11.x.

## Java Version

Stroom v7.10 requires Java 25.

{{% warning %}}
This is different to the java version required for Stroom v7.9 (Java 21).
{{% /warning %}}

Ensure the Stroom and Stroom-Proxy hosts are running the latest patch release of Java v25.


## Configuration File Changes

<!--
Check changes using something like this (run from an up-to-date stroom repo):
old_ver=7.10
new_ver=7.11
git diff origin/${old_ver}..origin/${new_ver} stroom-config/stroom-config-app/src/test/resources/stroom/config/app/expected.yaml
git diff origin/${old_ver}..origin/${new_ver} stroom-proxy/stroom-proxy-app/src/test/resources/stroom/dist/proxy-expected.yaml
-->

## Database Migrations

When Stroom boots for the first time with a new version it will run any required database migrations to bring the database schema up to the correct version.

{{% warning %}}
It is highly recommended to ensure you have a database backup in place before booting stroom with a new version.
This is to mitigate against any problems with the migration.
It is also recommended to test the migration against a copy of your database to ensure that there are no problems when you do it for real.
{{% /warning %}}

On boot, Stroom will ensure that the migrations are only run by a single node in the cluster.
This will be the node that reaches that point in the boot process first.
All other nodes will wait until that is complete before proceeding with the boot process.

It is recommended however to use a single node to execute the migration.
To avoid Stroom starting up and beginning processing you can use the `migrage` command to just migrate the database and not fully boot Stroom.
See [`migrage` command]({{< relref "/docs/user-guide/tools/command-line#migrate" >}}) for more details.
