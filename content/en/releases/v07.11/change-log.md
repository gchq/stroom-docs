<!--
To build this list run diff_changelog.sh in the root of the stroom repo.
E.g. ./diff_changelog.sh 7.10 7.11 | sed -E -e 's/^/\n/' -e 's|Issue \*\*#([0-9]+)\*\*|Issue **{{< external-link "#\1" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/\1" >}}**|g'

OR, if you use Vim use this command to read it straight into this buffer
(Hash '#' needs to be escaped with '\' to stop vim replacing it with the current file path)
:r !../stroom_v7_11/diff_changelog.sh 7.10 7.11 | sed -E -e 's/^/\n/' -e 's|Issue \*\*\#([0-9]+)\*\*|Issue **{{< external-link "\#\1" "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/\1" >}}**|g'
